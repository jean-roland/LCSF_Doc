This repository contains the documentation for the Light Command Set Format (LCSF).

It's based on an original idea of my former colleague Florian R. who came up with the idea while conceiving custom command set for embedded applications.

For more information, read the documentation on the github page [here](https://jean-roland.github.io/LCSF_Doc/).
