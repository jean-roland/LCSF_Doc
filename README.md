# Presentation

This repository contains the documentation for the LCSF Project.

It's based on an original idea of a former colleague, who came up with the idea while conceiving custom application protocols for embedded applications.

For more information, read the documentation on the github page [here](https://jean-roland.github.io/LCSF_Doc/).
